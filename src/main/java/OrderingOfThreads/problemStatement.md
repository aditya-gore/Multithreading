Design a concurrent program that prints the string "I am Aditya" using multiple threads, 
with each thread responsible for printing one word. 
All threads should be started simultaneously to achieve concurrent execution.

Requirements:

Create three threads, each concurrently printing one word ("I", "am", "Aditya") of the string "I am Aditya".
Ensure that the words are printed in the correct order, even though the threads are started simultaneously.

Sample Output:  
I
am
Aditya
